# About Me

I am a third-year master student in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), under the supervision of Prof. Yuxing Han. I earned my bachelor's degree from [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn) in 2023. 

My research interest focuses on **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**, especially **Efficient AI** algorithms and systems. From 2021, I started my research on efficient physiological time series analysis based on knowledge distillation. Now, I focus on efficient video computer vision systems with video motion estimation.

Feel free to contact me by email if you are interest in discussion or collarboration with me.
